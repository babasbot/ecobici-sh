# ecobici-sh

This is a work in progress.

## Getting started

The scripts on this project require the following ENVs:

- `ECOBICI_CLIENT_ID`
- `ECOBICI_CLIENT_SECRET`

To obtain an API key, you should register [here](http://bit.ly/3qvnIVH). You
will be asked for your name, email, and a brief usage description.

After registration, you will receive three emails, one with an activation link,
another with your user id, and the last one with your secret key.
